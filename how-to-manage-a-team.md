# How to manage a team

You can choose how to manage your teams, but here are some tips to get started!

## Ice breakers

The first day is awkward. In the afternoon, the teams get assembled, and you'll get to know each other.

Gather the team\(s\) you're leading. Play a game or have a list of questions available so you can get to know each other. Some examples:

* Let your team members take a prop with them that says something about themselves. This requires informing them beforehand.
* Let your team members make a short presentation of things they've made in school \(and outside school, something they're proud of\). This requires informing them beforehand.
* Prepare a list of questions that can break the ice
  * What's your name?
  * What is your top skill?
  * What is your favourite food?
  * What is _the one thing_ we should know about you?

## Scrum poker

### Scrumoji poker™️

Select 5 estimoji's from your pile of osoc cards that you received at the beginning of osoc. For example:

* Thumbs up
* Thumbs down
* Exhausted
* Happy hearts
* Poop \(Hankey\)

For every task you have set out the team to do, they can select one card to express how they feel about the task. This gives you an idea of the general mood!
