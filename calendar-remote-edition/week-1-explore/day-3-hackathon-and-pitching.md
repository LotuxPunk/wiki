# Day 3: Hackathon & Pitching

![](../../.gitbook/assets/osoc-2020-cal-week-1.003.jpeg)

## 09:00 \[team breakout only\] Continue Hackathon + optional user testing or interviews

Sync with your team, pick up where you left off and let's continue the hackathon!

Building something? Creating something? Talk to the people you're building it for! You can do user interviews and user tests.

## 13:00 \[team breakout only\] Continue Hackathon

Take the afternoon to round up your hackathon. By 16:00 we expect a video pitch to show off what you've learnt üòè

Keep in mind; the value lies in _learning together_, not in delivering a perfect project.

## 16:00 \[HARD DEADLINE\] Deliver your pitch!

Put your one-minute pitch video \[slides optional\] in our cloud by 16:00: [https://cloud.openknowledge.be/s/xjW6wXRbdoeXei4](https://cloud.openknowledge.be/s/xjW6wXRbdoeXei4)

Your pitch should include:

* Project description
* What the goal of your team's hackathon was
* What you've learnt



## 17:00 have a nice day ü•≥
