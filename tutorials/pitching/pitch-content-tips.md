# Pitch Content Tips

## Mood

_Tell us a story, take us on a journey. Grab our attention, slow down, ramp up the speed, build up â€“ give us a plot twist. Build up so we want to find out more about your project._

ðŸ’¡ Don't be high-energy or low-energy all the time. People will lose their attention.

![Grab attention &#x2013; play with speed &#x2013; build up to have them yearn for more.](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-07-14-at-09.42.59%20%281%29.png)

Create momentum, make a connection. Tell us a story humans can relate to.

## The Project

![Help us understand why we should listen](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-07-14-at-09.43.32.png)

What did you make? What problem are you solving? Why would it matter â€“ to me?

Tell me a story that I can relate to.

Remember those moments where you stare at people while theyâ€™re talking and youâ€™re nodding because they sound like itâ€™s important â€“ but you have no idea what theyâ€™re saying? This is what people like us sound like, 90% of the time. Make your audience understand.

![You don&#x2019;t need to sound smart, you need to make other people feel smart.](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-07-14-at-09.43.41%20%281%29.png)

That's how you turn other people into advocates of your project.
