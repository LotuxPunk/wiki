# Open Summer of Code

Open summer of code is for anyone who brings motivation, enthusiasm and talent to the table. This wiki has been brought to life to channel all of that energy, and create something valuable in the 4 weeks we have together!

ðŸš§ This wiki is still under construction â€” if you couldn't find something, please contact us at [info@osoc.be](mailto:info@osoc.be); and we'll make sure to add it. ðŸš§
