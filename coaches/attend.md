# Attend

## When & where am I expected?

Depending on what you signed up for, you'll be participating half-time or full-time.

Full-time: we expect you at the office during the month of July, from Monday through Thursday from 09:00 to 17:00.

Half-time: make sure you make a deal with the other coach you're coaching with, so the team always has a coach around.

You can find the location and calendar on your the website for your country's edition.

## Can we work remote?

Our current culture is non-remote. As Osoc is only 4 weeks long, and everything moves really fast — we need a coach around as much as possible.  
  
If you have any suggestions for a remote Osoc, let us know ;-\)

## Client meetings

It's very important a coach is present at the client meetings. Most of our students have no experience with attending or guiding a client meeting, so your presence is crucial — before \(preparation\), during \(guidance\) and after the meeting \(feedback\).

## What do I do when I'm ill?

It happens to the best of us. First of all, inform your organisation. They will make sure the word is out.

## Can I work on other projects while coaching?

You're being paid full-time, or half-time — depending on what you signed up for — so we expect your undivided attention.

## I really really really have to attend something...

Sometimes there's things more important than Open summer of code \(yes, we find that hard to believe as well!\). Please inform the organisation up front. We'll work something out. But we don't want your team to miss out on you for too long, they need you!
