# Battle Prep

Here's a non-exhaustive list of things you can do to prepare for battle. If you need any guidance, contact the organisation!

If you are a half-time coach and you have an other half-time coach or student coaches in your team, you can go through this together. Not sure what to do as a coach, and with half-time or student coaches? Read all about [tasks](tasks.md) and [Soft Skills & Expectations](soft-skills-and-expectations.md) first.

## Coaching teams together

### Different roles

#### Lead coaches

_When you're a coach, you'll be the lead of one \(or more\) project\(s\)._

The lead coach makes sure the teams knows what to do, and **creates the outline for the team** \(what does project management look like, what tools do we use to do project management, when do we do stand-ups, ...\). See [Decide on project management and structure](battle-prep.md#decide-on-project-management-and-structure) for more information.

We make sure every coach has back-up, in the form of support coaches and/or councillors. We try to pair coaches so they can fill each other's gaps, and they can learn from each other \(especially for first-time coaches\).

Coordinate and consult each other up front what the coaching st

#### Support coaches

#### Councillors

Councillors are volunteers that help out because they like the project, have a stake in it or just because they like osoc. They are specialists in certain fields that love to share their knowledge. There are two ways councillors help out:

1. They hang out in Discord when they choose to, and if there's a question, they try to answer it!
2. Some councillors give workshops during osoc.

We are trying this out in \#osoc21 â€“ and we'll see how it turns out!

### Get to know each other!

I don't know you, you don't know me.

* Tell them what you're good at \(skills and soft-skills like development, scoping sessions, challenging people, ...\)
* Tell them what you need help with
* Tell them about your coaching experience

## Decisions to make up front

### Decide on how you're going to break the ice with your students

Find some lovely ideas on [How to manage a team &gt; Ice breakers](../../how-to-manage-a-team.md#ice-breakers) âœ¨

Need more ideas? Drop a line in the discord coaches channel!

### Decide on project management and structure

How are you going to guide your students day to day? Find some tips and tricks here: [How to manage a team](../../how-to-manage-a-team.md) â€“ and take a look at our [tutorials on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEHc_BULYm1B3-xLdfwfktL5Qps6PW61u)!

Some examples to take care of:

* How will you track your todo's?
  * Decide who will teach the students
  * Decide on structure:
    * Backlog, To-do, In Progress, Blocked, In Review, Done?
  * Do you need labels?
    * Field: Back-end, Front-end, Design, Copy ...
    * Type: Enhancement, bug, question
    * Priority: High, medium, low, wont-fix ...
    * State of todo: Todo, In Progress, Blocked, To review, "Bad issue" \(not well-written, nobody understands\), question, invalid, duplicate, help wanted, ...
  * Where do you track issues?
    * GitHub? Kanban? Post-its? Trello?
* Will you let your non-devs work in GitHub as well? Who teaches them?
* Will you do stand-ups and stand-downs? What time?
* How will you do scoping sessions and retrospects?
* How will you give feedback at the end of osoc?

If you need any techniques, please contact the organisation, they are working on it now!

#### Decide on hand-over when you're not there

When you're not present, the other coach or your student coaches need to know what to do. Decide on how you're going to do that. Some possibilities:

* Assign a student to talk / type about what has been done in a structured way, for instance by using "kanban"
* Type it yourself, so the other coach can read it and have it close-by whenever they need it.
* Perhaps also prepare some key elements your half-time or student coach needs to pay attention to when you're not here. For instance "Student A had trouble with this. Can you make sure to follow up on it?"
* Create a shared calendar or excel sheet that outlines who to reach when, and who to ask for which kind of help \(councillors as well\).

### Tips-and-tricks calendar

We are in progress of creating a calendar that is supplemental to the calendar with the actual deadlines, that focuses on project management and giving the right information at the right time. Are you interested in applying this technique? Get in touch!

### Pitch the project

* The coaches will present the project in their Discord project channels once all students are in the channel.
* They will also pitch the project on the first day to their students when they figure out what the project is about. 

### Go through the deliverables document

At the end of osoc, we make sure the client and the open source community knows what this project was about, how to contribute and how to make it better. We made an exhaustive deliverable checklist to make sure this can happen!

You can do this together or separately, and discuss if you still have questions beforehand. Ask the organisation to clarify if needed!
