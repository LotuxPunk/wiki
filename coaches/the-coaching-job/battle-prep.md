# Battle Prep

Here's a non-exhaustive list of things you can do to prepare for battle. If you need any guidance, contact the organisation!

If you are a half-time coach and you have an other half-time coach or student coaches in your team, you can go through this together. Not sure what to do as a coach, and with half-time or student coaches? Read all about [tasks](tasks.md) and [Soft Skills & Expectations](soft-skills-and-expectations.md) first.

## In case you have a coach that coaches half-time with you, or have a student coach to help you out, get to know each other!

I don't know you, you don't know me.

* Tell them what you're good at \(skills and soft-skills like development, scoping sessions, challenging people, ...\)
* Tell them what you need help with
* Tell them about your coaching experience

## Decide on how you're going to break the ice with your students

Find some lovely ideas on [How to manage a team &gt; Ice breakers](../../how-to-manage-a-team.md#ice-breakers) âœ¨

## Decide on project management and structure

How are you going to guide your students day to day? Some examples to take care of:

* Where do you track your todo's?
  * Post-its, Trello, Kanban, GitHub?
* How will you track your todo's?
  * Decide who will teach the students
  * Decide on structure:
    * Backlog, To-do, In Progress, Blocked, In Review, Done?
  * Do you need labels?
    * Field: Back-end, Front-end, Design, Copy ...
    * Type: Enhancement, bug, question
    * Priority: High, medium, low, wont-fix ...
    * State of todo: Todo, In Progress, Blocked, To review, "Bad issue" \(not well-written, nobody understands\), question, invalid, duplicate, help wanted, ...
* Where do you track issues?
  * GitHub? Kanban?
* Will you let your non-devs work in GitHub as well? Who teaches them?

### Project management tips

#### Decide on how you're going to do scoping sessions and retrospects

Weekly scoping sessions and retrospects are crucial to finding out what you're going to build something, and if you're doing well as a team.

At the end of osoc you'll also give feedback to each individual, which you can prepare together. You can write some positive notes on a postcard too!

If you need any techniques, please contact the organisation, they are working on it now!

### Tips-and-tricks calendar

We are in progress of creating a calendar that is supplemental to the calendar with the actual deadlines, that focuses on project management and giving the right information at the right time. Are you interested in applying this technique? Get in touch!

## Decide on hand-over when you're not there

When you're not present, the other coach or your student coaches need to know what to do. Decide on how you're going to do that. Some possibilities:

* Assign a student to talk / type about what has been done in a structured way, for instance by using "kanban"
* Type it yourself, so the other coach can read it and have it close-by whenever they need it.
* Perhaps also prepare some key elements your half-time or student coach needs to pay attention to when you're not here. For instance "Student A had trouble with this. Can you make sure to follow up on it?"
* Create a shared calendar or excel sheet that outlines who to reach when, and who to ask for which kind of help \(councillors as well\).

## Pitch the project

The  coaches will present the project in their Discord project channels once all students are in the channel. The coach should also pitch the project on the first day to their students when they figure out what the project is about. 

## Go through the deliverables document

You can do this together or separately, and discuss if you still have questions beforehand. Ask the organisation to clarify if needed!
