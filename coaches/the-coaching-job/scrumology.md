# Scrumology

## Week 1: Exploration & Learning

Focus on **exploration and the bigger picture**. See [Get to Know Your Team](coaching-cases.md#get-to-know-your-team) and [Get to Know Your Partner & Project ](coaching-cases.md#get-to-know-your-partner-and-project)

Create a first **learning opportunity during the hackathon** in week 1 \(AKA making mistakes\).

* **Learn about the project**: pick something about the project that is important to the client, and where your team would benefit in learning together. Set a goal together "implement this technology" "find out if your target group wants to use that" "combine this dataset with the other one"
* **Learn about working together as a team**: it's a good time to start scoping and estimating. Almost every team will declare there wasn't enough time to finish what they started!  We have our [own version of scrum poker](how-to-manage-a-team.md#scrumoji-poker-tm), that is highly suitable for an osoc edition. It can reveil how confident everyone is about the tasks you've set up in the scope for your hackathon. You can use this during the week as well.
* **Learn about pitching**: The team will get two opportunities to pitch in week one already; and they'll only get better at it. Encourage \(but don't force\) everyone to try it!

## Week 2 & 3: Build Good Habits

Get that rhythm going;

* **Plan what you'll do at the start of the week** – based on the vision you've learnt about in week 1. [Scoping sessions are useful here](how-to-manage-a-team.md#how-to-do-a-scoping-session).
* **Check-in with each other every day**
  * Most people do stand-ups at the start of the day to see what everybody is up to and where they are stuck.
  * Make sure your team knows when they are expected to show up, and what they are supposed to do. Get some examples of how to do those stand-ups at [How to project manage](how-to-manage-a-team.md#how-to-project-manage).
  * You can do multiple stand-ups, even at noon; depending on what your teams need. Some teams also like doing stand-downs – this creates the opportunity to 
  * You can also do _stand-downs_ at the end of the day, to make sure you know everyone leaves the chat with confidence and won't mull about everything at night; so they can start the day fresh.
  * **If there's a part-time coach** helping you out, have students help you with writing a **summary** at the end of the day of what \(didn't\) happen – so that they are up-to-speed immediately.
* **Test what's being made**. Not just in code. Every week. We need real people to use what's been created and we want it to be [valuable to them](../../how-to-conduct-remote-tests-and-interviews-with-real-people.md).

### Check in & adapt

At the end of week 1, 2 and 3 it would be good to see how people did and how they felt with a retrospective.

To make sure people learn from their estimations, you can compare their estimations \(scrumoji™️\) to the outcome; also with emoji. Now is the time to see if the end-goal is still feasible, communicate with your client, and see where you can adapt.

Next time: overestimate, rather than underestimate.
