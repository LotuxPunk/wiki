# Buddy Coaches Battle Prep

If you have a buddy coach, here's a non-exhaustive list of things you can talk about to prepare for battle. If you need any guidance, contact the organisation!

## Get to know each other

I don't know you, you don't know me.

* What do you do for a living? What do you do in your spare time? Hobbies?
* Tell your buddy what you're good at \(skills and soft-skills like development, scoping sessions, challenging people, ...\)
* Tell your buddy what you need help with
* Tell your buddy about your coaching experience and style

## Decide on how you're going to break the ice with your students

The first day is awkward. In the afternoon, the teams get assembled, and you'll get to know each other.

Gather the team\(s\) you're leading. Play a game or have a list of questions available so you can get to know each other. Some examples:

* Let your team members take a prop with them that says something about themselves. This requires informing them beforehand.
* Let your team members make a short presentation of things they've made in school \(and outside school, something they're proud of\). This requires informing them beforehand.
* Prepare a list of questions that can break the ice
  * What's your name?
  * What is your top skill?
  * What is your favourite food?
  * What is _the one thing_ we should know about you?

## Decide on project management

How are you going to guide your students day to day? Some examples to take care of:

* Where do you track your todo's?
  * Post-its, Trello, Kanban, GitHub?
* How will you track your todo's?
  * Decide who will teach the students
  * Decide on structure:
    * Backlog, To-do, In Progress, Blocked, In Review, Done?
  * Do you need labels?
    * Field: Back-end, Front-end, Design, Copy ...
    * Type: Enhancement, bug, question
    * Priority: High, medium, low, wont-fix ...
    * State of todo: Todo, In Progress, Blocked, To review, "Bad issue" \(not well-written, nobody understands\), question, invalid, duplicate, help wanted, ...
    * 
* Where do you track issues?
  * GitHub? Kanban?
* Will you let your non-devs work in GitHub as well? Who teaches them?

## Decide on hand-over

When one of both coaches is not present, the other one needs to know what to do. Decide on how you're going to do that. Some possibilities:

* Assign a student to talk about what has been done in a structured way, for instance by using "kanban"
* Type it yourself, so the other coach can read it and have it close-by whenever they need it.
* Perhaps also prepare some key elements your buddy coach needs to pay attention to when you're not here. For instance "Student A had trouble with this. Can you make sure to follow up on it?"

## Pitch the project

The lead coach has to present the project in the Slack channels once all students are in the channel. The lead should also pitch the project on the first day to all the students.

Try it out on your buddy or an other coach, so they can have a smooth run!



## Go through the deliverables document

This is an example delivery document for your teams \(do not change it\): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Mecp0oCcfMNJipWnh4XROGbYHwBG\_KL0Zdm-Vrn6xc/edit?usp=drive\_web&ouid=116393943963382490089](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Mecp0oCcfMNJipWnh4XROGbYHwBG_KL0Zdm-Vrn6xc/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=116393943963382490089)

You can do this together or separately, and discuss if you still have questions beforehand. Ask the organisation to clarify if needed!

## Decide on how you're going to do scoping sessions and retrospects

Scoping sessions and retrospects are crucial to finding out what you're going to build something, and if you're doing well as a team.

If you need any techniques, please contact the organisation, they are working on it now!
