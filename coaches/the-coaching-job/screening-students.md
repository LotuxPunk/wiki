# Screening students

## What do we screen our students for?

### Filling out the Form

We expect students to take the time to fill out the form we created for them. The form is found on [https://osoc.be/students](https://osoc.be/students) â€“ and opens from March until end of May.

Most important:

* Motivation
* CV
* Portfolio / github / a website / proof of what they did!

### Motivation

Someone that is eager and motivated to learn is good to have on your team â€“ it bumps up the team morale! Coachable, hungry students grow _so_ fast.

The motivation letter usually reveals a big part; how fluent are they? What do they offer and hope to receive? Did they forget to replace the company name?

### Curriculum Vitae

#### Side projects

Side projects reveal a lot about someone's motivation; and if they have any prior work experience as well \(that wasn't mandatory as a school assignment\).

#### Education level

* First-year students
  * Usually students that are in year 1 of their education need some more time studying their craft to be part of osoc.
  * There is a real risk that they will fall behind and won't be able to help out a lot. This will drastically demotivate them and create tension in the team as well.
  * The occasional unicorn or people with relevant background do pop up. Their portfolio has to stand out _a lot_ to make up for the lack of experience in their work field \(side projects, working in teams, complex assignments in their work of field they are studying\).
* Second-year students
  * Make sure they succeeded their first year â€” zoom in on their portfolio, motivation and attitude. Some work that is not related to school is a huge plus.
* Third-year students
  * These students can take on some responsibility, which is nice. Zoom in on attitude and motivation! Their portfolio should be extended. Side projects where they had to deal with clients, group assignments and extra-curricular activities are a good sign of attitude and motivation.

### Proof in the Pudding

It's not enough just to have a motivation letter and a CV. We need proof of what they can do, and how they did it. Look for GitHub accounts, portfolio's, websites, ...

Can't find enough proof, but you see potential? Contact them and give them a call!

### Communication & Location

We need to be able to understand each other and work together.

#### Location

This means we unfortunately can't work together with people that live in other time zones for the remote edition, or with people that live too far away when it's an on-location edition. We expect students to be available to their clients, to be there when their teammates are and to be there when important announcements are made during live sessions.

We accept students for the remote edition from timezones that are a maximum of 2 hours apart, and if they can commit to being there when needed.

For editions that are on-location, we expect people from Belgium to participate, from the Netherlands or to find accommodation.

We also need to make sure we can actually pay students â€“ this depends from country to country and needs to be reviewed case-by-case.

#### Language

Our main language is English; we need people to speak pretty well to make sure we can understand each other. We can't teach people how to speak English on the job unfortunately.

If their CV is not written in English \(even though it should have been, this is not a great sign\), or you're not sure how fluent they are; you can give that student a call. To find out if you can have a decent conversation with a student, ask them about their experience, motivation and why they want to join.

### Type of projects

This is a tricky one; but we look for students to fit the projects that we will have. In the first round we don't know how many projects will land and which type of projects we will have. So it's a wild guess. What we do know

* we need developers
* we need web- and application designers
* we need a communication team
* _sometimes_ we need marketing / business managers / pure graphic designers / ...
* a photographer/someone that can create videos during on-location editions
* a motion designer/someone that can create videos during remote editions

Keep an eye on creating well-rounded teams with different skill sets and backgrounds. A team with limited skills \(for example only developers or designers\), or a team that has the same mother tongue isn't great for the goals we have in mind: diverse teams that deliver projects for diverse people!

### I am not sure.. ðŸ¤”

If there's something else that's wrong, or if you're not sure, give them a call and ask some questions. Conduct the interview in English.

### Negotiating about money.

We do not negotiate their pay. It's not about money.

## Screening students with _The Selection Tool_

You can 

* Yes
* Maybe
* No

## Assembling your team

After we've gone through selections, and we have some projects lined up, it's time to assemble your team â€“ see "[Tasks â€“ Assemble Your Team](tasks.md#assemble-your-team)"
