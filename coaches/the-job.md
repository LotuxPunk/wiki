# The Job

## What will I be doing?

As coach you will be guiding a team of students through the project development process. That includes discussions with your project partner to establish a clear vision of the specific open innovation project. You will endorse the desired student roles \(web development, design, business or communication\) essential to turning the partners idea into real-world products and services. At osoc you will outline a plan for action with your team and facilitate students' progress throughout the one-month project. In the end, your team will present the finished product to the partnering organisation and the wide public.

## Your main tasks

* Assemble your team

## What skills should I bring to the table?

An open attitude is vital. You will be working in a diverse team of motivated students with different skills and expertise. Hence, your role is to facilitate interaction within your team and between your team and partners. You'll be providing structure and guidance for the students to help them flourish and do a good job. Experience in coaching and team-coordination are not required but considered an asset. Furthermore, familiarity in the Belgian tech scene is valuable. However, what counts most is a positive mindset and the motivation to have an awesome summer!

## Your tasks

* Assemble your team: Make sure that your team is balanced. Match the right people with the right skills for the project, and make sure their characters will work \(see **What type of team will I have?**\). 
* Expectation management of client:
  * At the start of Osoc, it's your job to manage the partner's expectations \(just like you would in your own projects\). Keep in mind these are students, and it's _possible_ the outcome won't be what they want it to be. You'll have to adjust along the way in those 4 weeks.
  * Scoping a project is very important from the start. After you receive the briefing, ask the right questions to chop the tasks into smaller parts, prioritise the tasks and make sure the client knows what's absolutely not feasible, and what might be feasible. Not sure how to conduct a scoping session? Contact your organisation! 
* You'll be creating a process for your team from start to end. A non-exhaustive list of examples:
  * Make sure your team can communicate well, and has the tools to do so. For example: use week-plannings, physical or virtual stand-ups and retrospects.
  * Make sure your team can spot "danger" in time, and know how to get out of it. Are they stuck? What do they have to do to get un-stuck?
  * How do they ship features?
  * How does quality testing work?
  * How do they test with their target audience?
  * Will they conduct interviews?
  * How does that feedback roll back to the team?  Not sure how to create a process for your team? Contact your organisation! 
* You are the arbiter of quality. You decide what is shipped, what is not, and what is communicated to the client. Of course, it's the student's job to deliver good code, a good design and a decent communication plan. It is your job to have it tested \(by the students and yourself\), and deliver the right information to your client in times when you see fit. For instance, you can communicate every week, every two days or every day, after every big release… depending on what you see fit. As long as your client isn't left in the dark, up-to-date and can trust you. 
* Help your students to conduct client meetings \(at least once a week\). Depending on the level of experience, you can choose how to do it \(a very experienced team can probably do this on their own\). The meetings should be well-prepared \(agenda, demo, questions prepared\), well-executed \(concise, polite, clear\) and written down during the meeting \(meeting-minutes\). A feedback session is very helpful for the students to learn about what they can do better in the future.

## What kind of team will I have?

Before Open Summer of Code starts, we start screening the students beforehand. We will invite a limited amount of coaches to do the screening. After that, we start building teams. We all aim for a healthy mix; on skill-level and on character type. It's important that teams are balanced; you can't have all unicorns in one team, nor can you have all inexperienced students in an other. It's also good to have some introverts and some extraverts in one team; leaders and followers. These types of teams motivate and complete each other in social skills.

It happens a team isn't working together as well as you thought it would. This could be an issue of skill, experience or character. If this is the case, contact the organisation and find out if there's other teams you can switch members with. This can be hard, but keep in mind it's about the whole of Osoc, not just about your team. It could happen one of your rockstars might be switched out with someone less experienced; but is a better fit for Osoc.

## What do we screen our students for?

* Students must be able to express themselves in English, and understand others well. If their CV is not written in English, or you're not sure how fluent they are; give that student a call.
  * To find out if you can have a decent conversation with a student, ask them about their experience, motivation and why they want to join.
* We need students to be eager to learn!
* Students need a well-formulated CV and motivational letter.
* Portfolio's, githubs, writing pieces or some show-cases are important. If they lack this information, it's a bad sign — but you can give them a call to make sure they send some information over.
* Experience:
  * First-year students are usually not experienced enough to join Open Summer of Code. Their portfolio has to stand out a lot to make up for the lack of experience \(working in teams, complex assignments, dealing with clients\).
  * Make sure that second-year students succeeded their first year — zoom in on their portfolio, motivation and attitude. Some work that is not related to school is a huge plus.
  * Third-year students can take on some responsibility, which is nice. Zoom in on attitude and motivation! Their portfolio should be extended.
* We do not negotiate price. It's not about money.
* Not sure if you should hire this person? Give them a call. Conduct the interview in English.
