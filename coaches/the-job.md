# The Job

## What will I be doing?

As coach you will be guiding a team of students through the project development process. That includes discussions with your project partner to establish a clear vision of the specific open innovation project. You will endorse the desired student roles \(web development, design, business or communication\) essential to turning the partners idea into real-world products and services. At osoc you will outline a plan for action with your team and facilitate students' progress throughout the one-month project. In the end, your team will present the finished product to the partnering organisation and the wide public.

## What skills should I bring to the table?

An open attitude is vital. You will be working in a diverse team of motivated students with different skills and expertise. Hence, your role is to facilitate interaction within your team and between your team and partners. You'll be providing structure and guidance for the students to help them flourish and do a good job. Experience in coaching and team-coordination are not required but considered an asset. Furthermore, familiarity in the Belgian tech scene is valuable. However, what counts most is a positive mindset and the motivation to have an awesome summer!

## Your main tasks

* Assemble your team
* Expectation management of your client
* Creating a process and structure for your team
* Arbiter of quality
* Client meetings & contact
* Knowing your fellow \(student & assistant\) coaches

### Assemble your team

_Make sure that your team is balanced. Match the right people with the right skills for the project, and make sure their characters will work._

Before Open Summer of Code starts, we start screening the students beforehand. We will invite some coaches to do the screening. After that, we start building teams. We all aim for a healthy mix; on skill-level and on character type. It's important that teams are balanced:

* You can't have all unicorns in one team, nor can you have all inexperienced students in an other.
* It's also good to have some introverts and some extraverts in one team; leaders and followers. These types of teams motivate and complete each other in social skills.

This balance is hard to figure out beforehand. It happens a team isn't working together as well as you thought it would. This could be an issue of skill, experience or character. If this is the case, contact the organisation and find out if there's other teams you can switch members with. This can be hard, but keep in mind it's about the whole of Osoc, not just about your team. It could happen one of your rockstars might be switched out with someone less experienced; but is a better fit for Osoc.

### Expectation management of your client

* At the start of Osoc, it's your job to manage the partner's expectations \(just like you would in your own projects\). Keep in mind these are students, and it's _possible_ the outcome won't be what they want it to be. You'll have to adjust along the way in those 4 weeks.
* Scoping a project is very important from the start. After you receive the briefing, ask the right questions to chop the tasks into smaller parts, prioritise the tasks and make sure the client knows what's absolutely not feasible, and what might be feasible. Not sure how to conduct a scoping session? Contact your organisation!

### Creating a process and structure for your team

A non-exhaustive list of examples:

* Make sure your team can communicate well, and has the tools to do so. For example: use week-plannings, physical or virtual stand-ups and retrospects. 
  * You also can do scoping sessions now and then to break up the work into smaller pieces, and help students do better assessments of work load.
* Make sure your team can spot "danger" in time, and know how to get out of it. Are they stuck? What do they have to do to get un-stuck?
* How do they ship features?
* How does quality testing work?
* How do they test with their target audience?
* Will they conduct interviews?
* How does that feedback roll back to the team?  Not sure how to create a process for your team? Contact your organisation! For Belgium, contact Miet!

### Arbiter of quality

You are the arbiter of quality. You decide what is shipped, what is not, and what is communicated to the client. Of course, it's the student's job to deliver good code, a good design and a decent communication plan. It is your job to have it tested \(by the students and yourself\), and deliver the right information to your client in times when you see fit. For instance, you can communicate every week, every two days or every day, after every big release… depending on what you see fit. As long as your client isn't left in the dark, up-to-date and can trust you.

### Client meetings & contact

Help your students to conduct client meetings \(at least once a week\). Depending on the level of experience, you can choose how to do it \(a very experienced team can probably do this on their own\). The meetings should be well-prepared \(agenda, demo, questions prepared\), well-executed \(concise, polite, clear\) and written down during the meeting \(meeting-minutes\). A feedback session is very helpful for the students to learn about what they can do better in the future.

Keep your client up to date, and don't leave them in the dark. A client needs to be able to trust your team, and know what the team is up to. You can communicate every week, every two days or every day, after every big release… depending on what you see fit. 

You can delegate the communication, but make sure the students run it past you before they send it. Most students do not have a lot of experience communicating in a professional context.

At the end of Osoc, you'll also hand in a big delivery document with your students, that contains all the work. We'll share a link during Osoc.

### Knowing your fellow \(student & assistant\) coaches

You're a coach in the first place. But you'll also have other skills. For instance, you're a designer, a dev, a marketer, a copyright expert or a yogi.

Other teams might need your expertise to move forward; and you might need an other coaches' expertise as well. Osoc is all about sharing and learning from each other. So it's your job to figure out who is on board, to ask for help whenever you or your team needs it — and to help others out. Right now, we don't have a great system for this \(yet\), so grab your fellow coaches for lunch in the first week and get to know each other ;-\)
