# Assistant coaches

## I'm a buddy or assisting another coach. How does that work?

As a student coach you will be acting as the interface between students and coaches. Hence, listen carefully and mediate concerns and ideas between both parties. Student coaches are aimed to become the next generation of coaches, see this role as an opportunity to learn as much as possible about the relevant aspects of the project development.
