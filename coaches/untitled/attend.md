# Attend

## When & where am I expected?

Depending on what you signed up for, you'll be participating half-time or full-time.

Full-time: we expect you at the office during the month of July, from Monday through Thursday from 09:00 to 17:00.

Half-time: make sure you make a deal with the other coach you're coaching with, so the team always has a coach around.

You can find the location and calendar on your the website for your country's edition.

## Half-time or full-time?

The baseline is; a team of students should never be "alone". There should always be a coach _available_ that is up-to-date, and knows the partner they're working for. 

A coach can choose to coach half- or full-time. A half-time coach should be paired with an other half-time coach — so the **teams will never be** _**coachless**_. Half-time coaches should make sure one of both is always _available_ to the team\(s\), and do their coaching tasks.

### Availability 

Availability means being there for key moments, when the team needs you. Depending on the size of the team and how hard the project is, a coach can handle one or two teams.

#### Big or hard projects

* **Scope** Think a big or complicated web-application — or a medium project with a lot of students with different skills \(for example hardware mixed with software or for instance exhaustive research / creativity required\).
* **Size** Usually has a lot of students \(more than 8 team members\)
* **Coach** Needs a full-time coach, or two half-time coaches. This requires a lot of availability. A mini project on the side is possible but not required \(for instance an easy website or a very experienced team with a student-coach\).

#### Easy projects

* **Scope** Think a website, maybe with an integration with a fixed design. A project that is well-defined or easy to scope along the way.
* **Size** Minimum three students
* **Coach** There is always a coach _available_ to manage the smaller team and the client, but probably won't be occupied the entire time. It is possible that a coach \(or two half-time coaches\) is managing two small projects at the same time. The coach however, should be _available_ for both teams to coach them whenever they need it — see "[The job](../the-job/)".

## Can we work remote?

Our current culture is non-remote. As Osoc is only 4 weeks long, and everything moves really fast — we need a coach around as much as possible.  
  
If you have any suggestions for a remote Osoc, let us know ;-\)

## What do I do when I'm ill?

It happens to the best of us. First of all, inform your organisation. They will make sure the word is out.

## Can I work on other projects while coaching?

You're being paid full-time, or half-time — depending on what you signed up for — so we expect your undivided attention.

## I really really really have to attend something...

Sometimes there's things more important than Open summer of code \(yes, we find that hard to believe as well!\). Please inform the organisation up front. We'll work something out. But we don't want your team to miss out on you for too long, they need you!
