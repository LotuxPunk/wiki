# Partners

## Partners visiting

Some partners might just become almost part of the team, while others will only drop by 2 or 3 times.

We do have set days for clients to visit. An example:

* Every Tuesday, week 1 to 3
  * Week 1: briefing and questions
  * Week 2: presenting the result and findings from the hackathon
  * Week 3: presenting progress
* Tuesday in week 4 is optional
  * If you need some more guidance
* The Demo day
  * See the end result!

## Communicating with partners

Apart from the meeting days \(see previous topic\), it's a good idea to keep the partner up-to-date. A partner in the dark can be a worried one.

* You can email them the report of the meeting, to follow up
* Email them progress every week, maybe with some questions \(you decide the pace\)
* Email them before or after the demo day with the delivery document and relevant delivery information

Depending on your team, you can send out the email, or you can have the team send out te email. Set up a google doc, so everyone can read and comment, and then let a student send it from the entire team.

## Partners on your Slack channel

Only make partners join the slack if they ask and if you feel the students are comfortable with that.

When your partner does join your slack channel, it's recommended to create a separate slack room without your partner. This way you can discuss things internally when needed.
