# Projects

## What type of projects will I be working on?

We have a wide range of interesting projects — from NPO's to universities, and from startups to big corporates. But they all have to be open source. Take a look [last year's edition of Belgium](http://2018.summerofcode.be/).

### Execution

You have a clear idea in mind about the end result and the end user of the application. In that case the students will get the ball rolling during oSoc.

### Proof of concept 

You have pretty solid idea, but it still requires some finetuning. You might be uncertain about the feasibility of a certain idea, concept or solution. In this case the students can provide some clarity by providing a new proof of concept. The students will exercise some creative freedom and will spend some time ideating.

### Surprise us

No specific guidelines or preferences? You might want the \#oSoc experience, but you’re not sure about the expected end result. You're at the right address. Let the students surprise you with their creativity, enthusiasm and skills! The students will take it from here.

We try our best to pair the right coach with the right project. You have a say in this a couple of months before Open Summer of Code starts. Your job is to coach the team, to guide them to do a good job. You're not supposed to do their job — but it does help if you have some prior knowledge when it comes to the subject or the skills needed to complete the project. So do let us know what type of projects you like and what you're good at besides coaching \(which is your primary skill\).
