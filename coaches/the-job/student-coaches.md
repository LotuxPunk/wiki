# Student coaches

Yay, you're a student coach! This means you've been part of Osoc for a while, or you had experience with projects outside of Osoc. We're so happy to have you!

This is a nice opportunity to extend your skill-set. Student coaches are aimed to become the next generation of coaches, see this role as an opportunity to learn as much as possible about the relevant aspects of the project development.

## The job

You'll be getting a bit more responsibility. For instance, you might be part of a team with a coach that is not available all the time. This means, when that coach is not around, you'll be responsible to motivate the team and help them out.

Because you have some more experience, we recommend going around and share the knowledge you have with other teams. You'll get to expand our network and meet new people, and help out others. You can have a pet-project on the side, and help others in your spare time â€” but keep in mind, your team needs you most.

### A unique position

As a student coach you will be acting as the interface between students and coaches. Because you are someone that understands what it is to be a student and a coach, you have the unique position to mediate concerns and ideas between both parties. Use this position wisely ðŸ˜‡!
