# Soft Skills & Expectations

## Be their lion

Have their back. Guide your team to do the best they can. Support them and remove boundaries. If they shine, you shine.

## Protect your team

You'll be protecting your team. From the client, themselves, each other... and from yourself.

Make sure the _client_ knows what to expect, and _students_ get a grasp of what is realistic. Your students will want to build something amazing, but still have a lot to learn.

#### Curb their enthusiasm \(a little\)

Usually, the teams will want to make the client as happy as possible, which can result into overpromising. This mostly comes from a place of enthusiasm — but also a lack of experience. A good rule of thumb, is that an estimated task takes up 3.14 times more time than your team members estimate  \(refer to the rule of Π or pi\). Manage the expectations of your teams and clients into something realistic, and you've done a good job.

#### Curb your enthusiasm \(a little\)

It's hard to see someone struggle. That's no reason to pull their laptop from their hands and do it yourself. Use your words, give them examples.

Let your students struggle a little. Remember how you learnt to do the stuff you do? By figuring it out yourself.

#### Honesty & transparency

Clients might also expect more of the team. It's hard to estimate what a team is capable of. The only way to keep a client happy is to keep them informed. Make the scope of your project as tiny as possible per milestone \(a hackathon or sprint week, for instance\), and communicate honest and on a regular base.

## Let them do the work

Your students are here to learn. Let them fail and get better at it. See previous point!

## I have no idea what I'm doing

It happens to all of us. Sometimes, we have no idea what we're doing, and just roaring into the void. It's okay. We have your back — the organisation and the other coaches are there to help. Just reach out!
