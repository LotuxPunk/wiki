# Assistant coaches

Everybody needs to start somewhere. Not every coach knows what to do from the start, and this is why we have an assistant coach program. For a small par of your pay-check, other coaches can assist you with [coaching tasks](./). This includes:

* Scoping sessions \(SLIP\)
* Team assembly
* Creating structure for the team
  * Standups
  * Conducting retrospects
  * Workflow
* "Team crisis"
* etc.

In Belgium, you have a coach of coaches to help you out, in Spain — please contact your organisation.

We're working on our curriculum — and we'll be writing it down here. Feel free to reach out if you need some more information beforehand!
