# First-time coaches

Everybody needs to start somewhere. Not every coach knows what to do from the start, and this is why we have an assistant coach program. We assist you with [coaching tasks](./). This includes:

* Scoping sessions \(SLIP\)
* Team assembly
* Creating structure for the team
  * Standups
  * Conducting retrospects
  * Workflow
* "Team crisis"
* etc.

In Belgium, you have a coach of coaches to help you out, in Spain â€” please contact your organisation.

Feel free to reach out if you need some more information! Ping @m on slack, or mail [osoc@miet.be](mailto:osoc@miet.be).
