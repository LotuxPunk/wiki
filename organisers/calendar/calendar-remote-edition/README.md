# Calendar Example Remote Edition \(BE\)

{% hint style="danger" %}
This is an example of the remote edition fo 2020. Go to the website of your specific edition if you want to figure out what's happening now!
{% endhint %}

We are ambitious, but we have systems and a solid structure in place to make sure we reach our goals. The main principle is we **explore for one week, build and test for two weeks** and **prepare for the delivery in the last week**.
