# Reimbursements

## Personal expenses

We compensate all coaches' and students' public transports costs. They are free to come by car or book themselves a fancy hotel, but we don't reimburse those things.

Partners are not reimbursed.

## Team expenses

Each team gets the same budget. It should be communicated at the start of Osoc to the teams, and a sheet of expenses should be communicated should be shared with the coaches, so they can gather all invoices/expenses and add a picture.
