# Managing notifications

On Discord, you have fine-grained control over which notifications you receive at which time.

**Leave mentions for @everyone and @here on.** The only people who can use these are in the coordination team, and it's what we'll use when we need to be sure you read a message.

**To only receive notifications when you're mentioned:**
