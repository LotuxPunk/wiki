## Personal expenses

We compensate all your public transports costs. You are free to come by car or book yourself a fancy hotel, but we don't reimburse those things.

## Team expenses

There's a budget for each team every year, so you can dress up your booth at the demo day every year. We'll communicate about it at the start of oSoc.
