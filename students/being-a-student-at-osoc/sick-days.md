# Health, COVID, Insurance, Sick Days

## What do I do when I'm ill?

Stay home. It happens to the best of us. First of all, inform your coach(es). The coach will make sure the word is out. Once you've recovered, please send a sick note to [info@osoc.be](mailto:info@osoc.be).

### COVID-19 regulations

In Belgium, we follow Belgian regulations for the Belgian edition. At time of writing, they allow gatherings, but still encourage working from home.

This is why we have a _blended_ edition, where we see each other on important moments but work from home whenever we can.

For osoc Spain, please inform with your organisers.

#### Masks

You are not required to wear a mask, but it is recommended when it gets crowded. We will make sure the offices are ventilated.

## Insurance

Civil liability and workplace accidents apply to the students on our payroll.
