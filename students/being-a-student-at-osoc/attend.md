## How many days will I work?

We hire students that are eligible to work under a student contract for 16 full days \(128 hours\).

## Food

Bring your own sandwiches or get a snack on the road to fill your tummies with; there will be shops in the neighbourhood!

## What do I do when I'm ill?

It happens to the best of us. First of all, inform your coach\(es\). The coach will make sure the word is out. Once you've recovered, please bring a sick note to your coach.

## I really really really have to attend something...

Sometimes there are things more important than Open summer of code \(yes, we find that hard to believe as well!\). Please inform the organisation up front. We'll work something out. But we don't want your team to miss out on you for too long — we've selected you for a reason, and we need you!

## Can we work remote?

Our current culture is non-remote. As Osoc is only 4 weeks long, and everything moves really quickly \(we don't want to break things but we do\) — we need you around at all times. We have interesting workshops, talks, lunches, ping-pong battles and fun; so don't worry about being bored.  
  
If you have any suggestions for a remote Osoc, that's just as  fun, let us know ;-\)
