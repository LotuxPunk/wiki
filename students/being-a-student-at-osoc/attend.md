# Practical: When, where, how long, food, sick days, ...

## When & Where

In the month of July, from Monday through Thursday from 09:00 to 17:00 you'll be expected, fresh & clean, at the \(home\) office for that day.

You can find the location and calendar on the website for your country's edition.

* Belgium: [Calendar Remote Edition](../../organisers/calendar/calendar-remote-edition/)
* Spain: [https://2021.summerofcode.es/agenda.html\#](https://2021.summerofcode.es/agenda.html#)

## How many days will I work?

We hire students that are eligible to work under a student contract for 16 full days \(128 hours\).

## Food

Remote edition: We encourage you to take breaks and eat healthy \(when you can\)!

In real life edition: Bring your own sandwiches or get a snack on the road to fill your tummies with; there will be shops in the neighbourhood!

## What do I do when I'm ill?

It happens to the best of us. First of all, inform your coach\(es\). The coach will make sure the word is out. Once you've recovered, please bring a sick note to your coach.

## I really really really have to attend something...

Sometimes there are things more important than open summer of code \(yes, we find that hard to believe as well!\). We'll work something out. But we don't want your team to miss out on you for too long â€” we've selected you for a reason, and we need you!

If you cannot work 8 hours during a certain day, you should mail [info@osoc.be](mailto:info@osoc.be) at least 2 days in advance \(cases of emergency excluded\).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need to get your COVID-shot, we understand! Please tell us 2 days in advance.
{% endhint %}

## Can we work remote?

The \#osoc20 and \#osoc21 editions are fully remote! Occasional \(and fully optional\) gatherings with small groups can occur.
