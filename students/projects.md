# The Job

## What kind of project can I expect to work on?

All projects at osoc are being built open source and aim to create real-world impact. Over the last few years, students have got the opportunity to work on open innovation projects in different fields such as mobility, education, health, sports and biodiversity. Check out [last year's edition of Belgium](http://2018.summerofcode.be/) to see what kind of projects have been built by osoc students at the latest edition.
