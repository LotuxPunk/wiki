# Osoc Code of Conduct

The code of conduct applies to all attendees of Open summer of code, paid and unpaid, except for the enforcers \(cf. section A, paragraph 8\). Please read these rules carefully. If you infringe on one of them, you must fulfil a task from the punishments section, C.

No worries, we also have an achievements section. When we think you did a great job, there are some props to earn.

## **A Code of Conduct**

![Motivation &amp; Hard Work!](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2019-06-18-at-15.11.32.png)

### **§1 Git\(Hub\)**

1. Git is considered to be known.
   1. Devs \(front, back, AI, ...\) have to know how to develop with it
   2. All other profiles need to know how to create issues — but learning git is a _huge_ plus!
2. You will not commit a config file.
3. You will use branches for development code you’re working on, as explained at the Git 101. You’re free to ask for extra help when doing it.

### **§2 Gear**

1. You bring your own laptop.
2. You will not forget your battery charger. Ever.
3. Everything you use or borrow, must be returned in the same state as before.
4. You will lock your computer when leaving your desk.

### **§3 Location and work hours**

We have strict rules for the location:

1. Clean up your desk before leaving \(aka the clean-desk policy\).
2. Do not leave anything precious when you are not around.
3. Respect the building and area. Keep it clean, throw garbage in the bins, etc.
4. If someone from the partner organisations enters the room and has something to say, you stop all work and listen \(or at least, pretend to\).
5. You are at least 8 hours a day present at this location. You are welcome to fulfil these hours between 8am and 7pm. If you want to work late let us know. Specific locations might require special badges or a supervisor in order to be able to work past 7pm.

If you cannot work 8 hours during a certain day, you should mail [astrid@openknowledge.be](mailto:astrid@openknowledge.be) at least 2 days in advance \(cases of emergency excluded\).

### **§4 Programming**

1. You will document everything. All documentation has to be written in English.
2. You will write code to the best of your efforts.
3. Your work is, unless, in some very rare cases stated otherwise, open source and will be shared with your neighbours, working towards a best-effort cross pollination policy.
4. Projects are copyrighted 2019 by Open Knowledge Belgium, the author is you. At the top of every file there should be a copyright notice and author notice, before committed to the GIT repository.
5. All PHP projects use the PSR-2 code standard. More info @ [https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md). For other programming languages, coding standards must be followed.
6. Your code should not allow SQL-injection, XSS-ing, etc
7. Whenever you’re about to write a 300+ line file, you first ask yourself whether you would need a rewrite and if you don’t think so, you ask the permission to commit the file from a dev coach.

### **§5 You’re an ambassador**

1. During the event, interest\(ing\|ed\) people \(e.g., journalists, potential employers, experts\) may enter the location. When they’re asking about your project, cease work and answer them in a best-effort way.
2. Everyone in your team is an ambassador of the project, without exception \(yes, also the back-end coder\). You will explain your project with pride and will train yourself to pitch the project as if it was your start-up.
3. The project doesn’t end at the last day of \#osoc19. You should try to “design” your open source project that it becomes a win for you when you are asked to pitch your project later on, or when you’re contacted by journalists, asked to attend an event, and so forth.

### **§6 Communication**

1. All official communication, documentation and so on has to be done in English. You are free to speak your native language when talking to your neighbour. From the moment you’re in a group with someone who does not speak the same language, you switch to English.
2. Our communication and project managers are responsible for the general management across and between the different projects. When they ask you to do something, you drop all work and help them in a best-effort manner.

### **§7 Blog**

1. You are expected to write a blog post about the project you’re working on at least once during the Open summer of code. Ask our communication manager about it.
2. As said before, all communication happens in English, therefore also the blog. We don’t expect complete articles, a few paragraphs that explain the progress of your project is enough. Feel free to ask for help from our communication and project managers.
3. People like pictures, don’t be afraid to take photographs or add some images to the blog post or online messages.

### **§8 Enforcers**

The board members of Open Knowledge Belgium and the freelancers are the enforcers of this code of conduct.

1. The enforcers are above this code of conduct; they cannot be punished.
2. The board members of Open Knowledge Belgium are free to change the code of conduct at any time. When changes take place, all Open summer of code members will be informed. The last, true, version of the code of conduct is available at [https://help.osoc.be/global/students/the-student-job/code-of-conduct](https://help.osoc.be/global/students/the-student-job/code-of-conduct).
3. Project leaders, as mentioned in **section D**, can enforce the code of conduct. When in doubt, you can contest charges from a project manager to someone of the board.

## B. Osoc Tokens or "Lives"

![Give each other a chance to learn and create something meaningful together.](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2019-06-18-at-15.11.39.png)

At the beginning of Osoc, you'll be given a set of tokens. This can be a set of lollipops \(don't eat them yet\), badges, dices, ...

These are your Osoc lives. They can be used for two things:

* Asking help or feedback from an other student.
  * Search for the student that has the skill you need to fix your problem, or that can give you the right feedback.
  * Ask if that student can help you. The student must help you, or give a \(reasonable\) time frame when they can help you out.
  * Offer them your token.
  * Enjoy the help, and the giving.
* Bailing you out of a punishment — see punishments in section B.

If you do not have any tokens left, and still need help: offer your expertise to give feedback or help out the other person in return. Or just ask really nice.

## **C. Punishments**

![Challenge &amp; support each other, to get the best of each other.](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2019-06-18-at-15.19.30.png)

When you infringe on one of the rules, you must choose one punishment.

* P1: Buy beers for the team of the person that spotted your infringement — and yourself. Drink it together.
* P2: Get ice cream for the team of the person that spotted your infringement — and yourself. Brain freeze together.
* P3: Give the person that spotted your infringement a token \(cfr. section B\). If you have no tokens left, choose from P1 or P2.

Infringing  on one of the rules multiple times does not grant you remission at any time.

## D. Achievements

![Respect each other, and show your appreciation.](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2019-06-18-at-15.11.18.png)

There are lots of achievements to obtain. Here’s a hint on what we’re scoring you, on the final day we’ll hand over some cool badges to the winner\(s\) of each part.

You'll be asked to vote for your fellow students, for the following achievements:

* A1: GitWizard = Wizard of contributions & commits
* A2: BlogMaster = Master of the digital written word
* A3: The Dribbbler = Their designs are dripping in gold & usability glitter
* A4: Multilingual = Knows so many \(code\) languages!
* A5: Presentator = You are a true Erlich Bachmann

Some achievements you can only get by chance:

* A6: The Punisher = Got the most tokens left. Or you're wonderful at helping people, or you're very good at spotting infringements...
* A7: The Rascal = Got the least amount of tokens left. Or you actually _got the guts_ to go out and ask for help unlike your colleagues, or you were a true rule "bender"...
* A8:  Bingo! = Because Bingo

The rest of the achievements will be voted by the coaches and the organisers:

* A9: The Apprentice = Learner of skills and magic
* A10 The Carebear = You take care of your team. You could've been a coach.
* A11: Little Sunshine= Always look on the bright side of life
* A12: Early Bird = When are you not here?
* A13: Determinator = You've got your eyes on the prize, dedicated to get to that deadline and you make every minute count.
* A14: Mr. Propre = You reinvented the clean desk policy
* A15: MVP = We’ll recommend the s\*\*t out of you afterwards

## **E. Your freedoms**

![Freedom for everyone!](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2019-06-18-at-15.11.25.png)

### **§1 Freedom to change projects**

If you don’t feel at ease in your team or you feel the project you are on is not suited for you, you are free to change projects once. If this is the case, please send an email to [astrid@openknowledge.be](mailto:astrid@openknowledge.be)  or talk to Astrid in person.

### **§2 Freedom of tools**

Except for Git and SSH, you are free to use any software or hardware stack that you are accustomed to. Our servers run Debian and are set up with a LAMP stack by default.

### **§3 Freedom to learn**

1. You cannot know everything. You are free to ask questions to anyone on another project who seems to have the best expertise on that subject.
2. You are free to request any project’s source code.

### **§4 Freedom to work whenever you’re most productive**

You are requested to attend Open summer of code 8 hours a day, which you are free to choose from the hours the location is open. As long as you are capable to deliver at every milestone, you’re safe.

### **§5 Freedom of speech**

You are free to tweet, using the proper hashtags \#Osoc19, use Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat, or any other social network, whenever you want to say anything about Open summer of code. As long as you're not harassing or hurting other people.

You can tweet about anything on social media, but if there are any issues come to us first!

### **§6 Freedom of information**

Open Knowledge Belgium aims to be 100% transparent. Therefore you can request any kind of non-privacy-prone information about the non-profit organisation and the Open summer of code event. Visit [be.okfn.org](http://be.okfn.org/) for more details.
